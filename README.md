# My *neovim* conifgs
These are the config files and plugins I use for [*neovim*][nvim], my text
editor of choice. They're honestly nothing fancy at all.

When using this config for yourself, always remember to install packer with
<!--I tried to do a custom install location and nvim did not like it one bit.-->
```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim\
~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim
```

Remember when you're installing these configs to make sure that you so on any
files you change. (Ughhhhhh.)

In all honesty, reconfiguring this to use lua has been a pain in my
assâ€”hopefully it'll pay off soon.
